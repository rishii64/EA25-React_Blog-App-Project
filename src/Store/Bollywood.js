He is being lauded by one and all for his evil and menacing act on-screen. Deepika Padukone and Shahid Kapoor’s roles are powerful too, however the audience has been going gaga over Ranveer’s performance in the film as Alauddin Khilji.When asked by a noted journalist if him getting the maximum attention makes things awkward. He replied, “Everybody is a part of the same film. I am not into one-upmanship at all. I have done a two-hero film, I have done an ensemble film. I am not into all this at all. I have a theatre background, so for me it is all about collaborating. It is a very collaborative process. You are only as good as your co-actor. Take Jim Sarbh for instance, he enhances my performance. Alia Bhatt, in Gully Boy, I feel like I don’t have to do anything, she is doing it for me. I just have to be there and react. This is the type of collaborative approach I have. I am not into ‘I am going to do my thing and let’s see what he got’. I am not into the competitive vibe. I feel it harms. It’s rooted in negativity and I am not that definitely.”",

Let the works happen and in the meantime, I will share about it,” reassuring that something indeed is in the works for 1 or 2 films but he doesn’t want to reveal anything this early and spoil the fun.

He also discloses his plan to embark on a dangerous mission to clear his name. When Khan said, 'Jab taak Tiger maara nehi, tab taak Tiger haara nehi' (Until Tiger dies, Tiger is not defeated), really gives goosebumps and increases the anticipation for the trailer.Tiger 3, featuring one of the beloved on-screen pairs Salman Khan and Katrina Kaif, is the third installment of the famous spy series. The first two films, Ek Tha Tiger and Tiger Zinda Hai are considered to be massive hits at the box office, which is why there is a great expectation from the upcoming Tiger 3. We are expecting to have a glimpse of an interesting story in the trailer. Unlike previous films where Tiger fought villains, this film deals with the super spy facing a significant betrayal and being accused of being a traitor by his own nation.From the look of the teaser shared by YRF, we are expecting some power-packed music to complement the high-octane action sequences and the chemistry between Tiger and Zoya. The background music and some songs full of beats would make the film superior. ",

The slice-of-life drama features a talented cast including Ratna Pathak Shah, Dia Mirza, Fatima Sana Sheikh, and Sanjana Sanghi in the lead roles. Recently Fatima Sana Shaikh heaped praise on the film’s producer Taapsee Pannu and opened up on how she she had faith in her even though Fatima is not an “A-listed” actor. During a recent interaction with News18, Fatima Sana Shaikh revealed that Dhak Dhak was a significant and valuable experience for her. She acknowledges that she doesn't have control over how commercially successful her films become, but she considers herself lucky to have a producer like Taapsee Pannu who chose to work with her on Dhak Dhak. She said, “Finding individuals who have faith in actors who aren't A-listed stars can be challenging. While these actors might be talented, they aren't considered A-listers, and that's a fact. Making a film with an A-listed actor is a different scenario because it attracts more attention.”She further added, “However, it's commendable when a producer and director follow their instincts, have faith in us, and believe that we can pull it off. It gives actors like me hope that films like this can also be made with me in such roles.” ",
